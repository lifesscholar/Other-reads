After a battle with the giant spider, Shelob, Sam left his master for dead; but Frodo is still alive--in the hands of the Orcs. And all the time the armies of the Dark Lord are massing. J.R.R.

After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit.\n\n        In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care.

It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.\n        However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game.
